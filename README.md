an app for server gratuity, splitting the check, and shopping discounts

Using this as a template before I try a react / react native app for ios/android

want to use this to check ux/ui

Maybe I should add a unit cost ?

Like when you're in the grocery store and trying to figure out if the 6 pack, 12 pack, 20 pack or, 24 pack of Coke cans is the best deal.

Who wants to read those tiny little tags?
